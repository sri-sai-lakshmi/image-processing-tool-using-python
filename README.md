This project focuses on the development of a user-friendly web-based Image Processing Tool designed to perform basic and advanced image manipulations. Built using the Flask Framework for the backend and standard web technologies (HTML, CC, JavaScript) for the frontend. The application allows users to upload and process images in the formats like PNG, JPG, JPEG, BMP and DICOM. Key operations include grayscale conversion, brightness adjustment, resizing the image, cropping the image, rotation of the image, color inversion, and image mirroring.
A unique feature of this tool is its support for DICOM CT and MRI image uploads. The operations that can be performed on these images is image registration, blending using alpha, multiply or false color methods.
The application also provides an interactive zoom tool for detailed inspection of the medical images. Real time previews and UI interactions make it accessible for both general and medical imaging use cases. 
This project demonstrates the integration of image processing algorithms with a full stack web architecture, offering both technical depth and practical utility in the field of digital image manipulation.
